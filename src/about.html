                <p>I first began experimenting with wed development back in 2001. I was among the first classes in my school to take classes on web development and learning HTML. I have since been able to experiment and learn CSS and some Javascript and jQuery through personal projects and experiments.</p>

                <p>A bulk of my learning occurred when I began work at EKR Agency. I was taught mostly in a Wordpress setting, and I learned some PHP as well as expanded my CSS, Javascript, and jQuery knowledge. I'm currently attending school at MATC to learn more and improve my development skills and speed.</p>
